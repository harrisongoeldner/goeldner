Hey! I am Harrison Goeldner a Trinity Western Student studying biotechnology and chemistry. But before we get into that… a bit about me!

I was born in Toronto, Ontario and grew up there for about the first ten years of my life. I moved around a lot and made friends here and there. One particular memory I have from this time was the power going out. Boy did those storms get wild.

Now living in British Columbia it’s the one thing I miss… the thunderstorms. There is so much peace yet power contained in them. A beautiful work of God.

My family moved to British Columbia for work and the fact that we had some family out here. I went to a small private semi online school called Regent during my high school years. I made many fond memories there.

Now I am on the exciting part of life in which one goes to university! As already mentioned I am studying biotechnology and chemistry. What does that entail you might ask?

Well I’m not completely sure either… or wasn’t sure when I first heard about it. Biotechnology is exactly what it sounds like: the application of technology upon biology. More specifically it is the exploitation of biology to be used for industrial or other purposes.

This worked perfectly for me! Over my high school years I had developed a passion for research and the sciences. I love researching technology and different medical papers.

But enough about me! This blog is about my adventures in biology, chemistry, technology, and life (yes us Canadians us commas that way).

I hope you enjoy!
